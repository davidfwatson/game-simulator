Hello, this is Ed, Uncle Hat. Fred Horn's House of Sleep... At the well, they're the proprietors with mattresses, skateboards, lamps, new gummies they got there behind the counter. They're supposed to help you sleep. I tried one the other day and I slept like a baby. I woke up every three hours. It's an old joke. I slept for a day and a half, but that's neither here nor there. They don't have essential oils at the moment because of the mishap, but Beatrice is fine. Anyway, come on down to Horn's House of Sleep. You don't need to count your sheep if you go to Horn's.
