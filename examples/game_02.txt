And the oh-one pitch... Reed is camped under it... and he makes the catch.

And Nate Diaz will step in with two down and nobody on.
And the pitch... Fastball, called a strike. Oh and one.
And the oh-one... fights it off. Oh and two.
And the oh-two pitch... Sent on the ground to first. Washington up with it, over to first.
