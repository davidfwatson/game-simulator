The oh-one pitch... hit foul down the line, oh and two.
And the oh-two pitch... Slider low and away, one and two.
And Malone's pitch... Slider, swung on and missed for strike three, and Sam Decker goes down swinging for out number two.

And Jackson Riley steps in against Rollie Malone. Runners on second and third, two down.
Righty against righty.
And Malone comes to the plate... Sinker, swung on and missed. Oh and one.
And the pitch... Hit in the air down the line! the fielder racing after it... he will not get there, as that one sails over the wall for a long, lazy home run! And the Bay Area Bombers take a 6-to-5 lead here in the bottom of the ninth.
