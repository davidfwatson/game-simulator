Runner on second and third, two down, for Jackson Riley.
Righty against righty.
And the pitch... Sinker, he takes an awkward hack at the pitch. Oh and one.
Oh-one, pitch on the way... Sails over the wall for a long, lazy home run! And the Bay Area Bombers take a 6-to-5 lead here in the bottom of the ninth.

==================== GAME OVER ====================
Final Score: Bay Area Bombers 6 - Pacific City Pilots 5
Bay Area Bombers win!
